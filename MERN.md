  # MERN Stack Interview Questions
  
   ### What is MERN stack?
    
   ##### MERN stack is a popular web development stack that consists of four main components: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB is used as the database, Express.js is used as the web application framework, React.js is used for the user interface, and Node.js is used as the server-side runtime environment.

   ### What is the difference between React and Angular?

   ##### React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Angular is a full-fledged framework for building complex web applications. React relies on a component-based architecture, whereas Angular relies on a modular architecture.

   ### What is JSX in React?

   ##### JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. JSX is used in React to define the structure of the user interface.

   ### What is a virtual DOM in React?

   ##### The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM in memory. It is used by React to optimize the performance of updates to the user interface. When a change is made to the virtual DOM, React compares it to the previous version of the virtual DOM and only updates the parts that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire user interface.

   ### What is Express.js?

   ##### Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP requests and responses, as well as middleware for handling common tasks such as authentication and error handling.

   ### What is middleware in Express.js?

   ##### Middleware is a function that sits between the client and the server in an Express.js application. It can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling, and it can modify the request and response objects before they are sent back to the client.

   ### What is Node.js?

   ##### Node.js is a server-side runtime environment for JavaScript. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server, which enables you to build scalable and high-performance web applications.

   ### What is MongoDB?

   ##### MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents, which makes it easy to work with data that has a complex and dynamic structure.

   ### What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?

   ##### SQL databases use a structured data model, which means that data is stored in tables with predefined columns and rows. NoSQL databases use a document-oriented data model, which means that data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents.

   ### What is RESTful API?

   ##### A RESTful API is an architectural style for building web APIs. It uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on resources, and it uses URLs to identify the resources. A RESTful API is stateless, which means that each request contains all the information necessary to complete the request.
